== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin but I don't see a summary? =

You have to turn on the summary per form. The plugin has its own settings page under form settings. Look for GF Summary Add-on in the form settings menu. 

= The summary remains empty? =

Don’t forget to turn on the checkbox “turn on summary” in the general settings of each field that needs to show in the summary. Still not working? --> please contact me.

= I don't see a total in the summary? =

There are two conditions to see the total in the summary. Firstly you have to have at least one product field in the form. Secondly you need to make sure that the "Show total" setting is turned on. You can find this setting on the settings page.

= I want to show the summary inside the form instead of next to the form?

This is possible with the Pro version of this plugin. It adds a new field to gravity forms and also adds support for live merge tags in HTML fields. Purchase Pro version [here](https://geekontheroad.com/live-summary-for-gravity-forms/) 

= I want to change the output of the summary, do you help? =

Yes, send me a message and tell me what you would like and I will do my best to help you. (Paid service)

== Screenshots ==

1. Empty summary shows next to the form on laptop and under the form on mobile.
2. Summary is filled while making selections in the form.
3. Plugin settings page. Here you can turn the summary on or off.
4. Field settings. All supported fields have a checkbox to control visibility in the summary
